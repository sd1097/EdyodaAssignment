Assignment 3:
Approaches:

i. First, we should check the port status

sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN

ii. If the port is already listening,check the services whether it is on ClusterIP or NodePort.

cmd: - kubectl get svc

iii. If it is of type ClusterIP, then we should change it to NodePort using below command

cmd:- kubectl edit service #servicename

iv. After changing the type of Service if it is not working then we delete all the old pods and services and apply the replicaSet.yaml it will create the services again.

cmd: - kubectl apply -f replicaSet.yaml

v. we will try to run the application. If it fails to run again then the last option is to change the port in replicaSet.yaml.
